py-sdshare-utils
================

A collection of [SDshare](http://www.sdshare.org) utilities written in Python.

So far it contains:

* *sdshare-server*: a simple SDshare server wrapper around SQL databases
* *sdshare-writer*: a simple HTTP web service for writing RDF data to SQL databases

These two utilities are mostly proofs of concept right now.
